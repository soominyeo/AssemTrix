# What is AssemTrix
AssemTrix is a simple assembly language based game, on a matrix space. We have a Virtual CPU running on a shared memory map along with other devices. 
Player can simply enter input data, or instructions so that they work as the player intended.

# Motif
I've always thought about game running on a matrix with some simple, intuitive principles. And AssemTrix is due to one of my those approaches.

&nbsp;
## 1. Naming
Simply enough, AssemTrix is made up of two words, Assemble and Matrix. This might sound kinda cheap, but other alternative I could think already exists or hard to understand at a look.

&nbsp;
## 2. Objectives
I tried my best to make it easier, though challenging. AssemTrix aims for simple boardgame based puzzle game with a various modes and stages.
